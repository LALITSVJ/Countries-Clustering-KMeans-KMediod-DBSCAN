# Countries-Clustering-KMeans-KMedoid-DBSCAN
Clustering Countries Based on Socio-Economic and Health Factors using different clustering methods.

The primary objective of this project is to classify countries into clusters based on various socio-economic and health factors using unsupervised machine learning (KMeans, KMedoid and DBSCAN clustering) algorithms. The goal is to categorize countries into three main clusters: developed, developing, and underdeveloped.
